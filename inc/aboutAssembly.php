                    <h3>Legal Framework</h3>
<p>The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) is one of the Two Hundred and Sixty-One (261) Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in Ghana and among the Twenty-Nine (29) MMDAs in the Greater Accra Region. It was established in 1898 but has gone through several changes in terms of name, size and number of Sub-Metros. When Ghana returned to constitutional rule in 1993, it derived its legal basis from Local Government Act, 1993, (Act 462) which currently has been amended as the Local Governance Act, 2016 (ACT 936), and under Legislative Instrument (L.I) 2034.</p>
<h3>Population</h3>
<p>According to the 2010 Population and Housing Census, the total population of the Metropolis was 1,665,086 with females constituting 51.9 percent while males formed 48.1 percent. Using the Greater Accra Population growth rate of 3.1%, the 2018 population of Accra is estimated at 2,036,889. Accra has a daily influx of more than 2 million people who commute to the City for various socio-economic activities. It is therefore estimated that Accra has a daily population of about 4 million comprised of both residents and visitors.</p>
