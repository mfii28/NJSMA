                        <p> Accra has been Ghana&rsquo;s capital since  1877 when it was transferred from Cape Coast. Today it is one of the most  populated and fastest growing Metropolis in Africa with a population of one  million six hundred and sixty-five thousand and eighty six (1,665,086) and an  annual growth rate of 3.1%.</p>
                        <p> The first attempt to set up a Town  Council dates back to 1859 under an Ordinance, which was annulled in January  1861. However, in 1898, the Accra Town Council was formally established under  the Town Council Ordinance of 1894.</p>
                        <p> The first meeting of the Council was  held on 14th February in the same year. The Accra Council was established in  1943 under the Accra Town Council Ordinance. In 1944, a new constitution came  into being after the Accra Town Council had existed for 46 years with an  elected membership of Seventy-Five (75) appointed by the Government and two appointed  by the Ga Native Authority. The Constitution was again revised in September,  1953, thus enlarging the membership from 14 to 31, and establishing the Accra  Municipal Council; 27 representatives for the Wards and four representing the  Traditional Authority.</p>
                        <p> After Ghana attained Independence in  1957, an amendment was made to the 1953 constitution and it wiped off traditional  representation completely.&nbsp; The Council became a wholly representative  institution. The Accra City Council was the first of the 58 District Councils  to be integrated under the New Local Government System to promote efficiency in  the administrative machinery of the Council and to meet the ever-pressing  demand for amenities and essential services by the ratepayers. Six Area  Councils were created under the new system. These six Area Councils are  Ablekuma, Ashiedu Keteke, Kpeshie, Okaikwei, Ayawaso and Osu-Klottey, which are  semi-autonomous.</p>
                        <p> On the 29th June 1961, Accra was  declared a City and the Council thus became the Accra City Council.&nbsp; A  further development took place in March 1963 with the establishment of the  Accra-Tema Development Corporation with responsibilities for certain functions  that were formerly carried out by the Council.</p>
                        <p> The Accra City Council was dissolved  in August 1964; after which the Greater Accra area was created and a Special  Commission was appointed. The Special Commission was made administratively  responsible for the Accra-Tema City Council.&nbsp; Also in the same year, the  Executive Chairman of the Accra-Tema City Council was appointed.</p>
                        <h3> Governance</h3>
                        <p>  Article 240 (1), Chapter 20 of the  1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana states that, &ldquo;Ghana shall have a  system of Local Government and Administration which shall, as far as  practicably be decentralized&rdquo;. This provision gave legal support to the decentralization  programme, which was initiated in Ghana in 1988 by recognizing the existence of  a decentralized programme in Ghana. The constitution is designed to provide a  general legal framework for the governance of Ghana; it further enjoins the  Parliament of Ghana to enact the necessary laws to ensure the smooth implementation  of the decentralized programme.</p>
                        <p> To this effect Article 240 (2)  provides some guidelines to Parliament on what the specific Local Government  law should contain. This is the justification for our Local Government Act,  1993 (Act 462), which was promulgated to establish and regulate the Local  Government systems in accordance with the Constitution and to provide for other  connected purposes.</p>
                        <p> The Local Government Act 1993 (Act  462) has provisions for the following: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creation of Districts</li>
                            <li>Establishment of District       Assemblies</li>
                            <li>Composition of the District       Assemblies</li>
                            <li>Qualification and       disqualification of members of the District Assemblies</li>
                            <li>Functions of the District       Assemblies</li>
                            <li>Planning and other Functions of       the District Assemblies etcâ€¦</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Constitution in Article 241  makes provision for the establishment of the District Assemblies and the  boundaries of the Districts. It goes on to recognize the District Assemblies as  the Lowest National Administrative Organs. Structurally, the AMA is made up of  the General Assembly at the apex, followed by Ten (10) Sub-Metropolitan  District Councils which are subordinate bodies of the Assembly performing  functions assigned to them by the instrument that sets up the Assembly or  delegated to them by the Assembly.&nbsp; </p>
